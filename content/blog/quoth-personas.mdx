<Callout type="info">
  **Update:** Personas have been replaced by the lightweight `quoth_guidelines` tool. See the [Quoth Plugin launch post](/blog/quoth-plugin-launch) for the new approach with 92% fewer tokens.
</Callout>

Quoth isn't just an MCP server—it's a complete documentation enforcement system. At its core are three specialized personas that change how Claude interacts with your codebase.

## The Problem: AI That Doesn't Know Your Rules

When you ask Claude to write code, it draws from general knowledge. It doesn't know:

- That your team uses Vitest, not Jest
- That your API follows specific naming conventions
- That certain patterns are explicitly forbidden

The result? Code that works but doesn't fit your architecture.

## The Solution: Persona-Driven Development

Quoth introduces three personas that change Claude's behavior:

<CardGrid>
  <Card
    title="Architect"
    description="Search-then-write: enforces patterns before generating code"
    icon="Wand2"
  />
  <Card
    title="Auditor"
    description="Review-then-report: distinguishes violations from new features"
    icon="FileSearch"
  />
  <Card
    title="Documenter"
    description="Build-then-document: creates structured docs as you code"
    icon="Pencil"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Activating Personas

Personas are activated with the `/prompt` command in Claude Code:

```bash
# Before writing code
/prompt quoth_architect

# Before reviewing code
/prompt quoth_auditor

# Before documenting
/prompt quoth_documenter
```

Once activated, the persona stays active for your entire conversation.

## The Architect Persona

**When to use:** Before writing any new code

The Architect enforces a "search-then-write" pattern:

1. **Search first** — Claude queries Quoth for relevant patterns
2. **Read documentation** — Fetches full content of matching docs
3. **Generate code** — Writes code that follows documented patterns
4. **Cite sources** — References which docs influenced the output

<Callout type="tip">
  The Architect never generates code without searching Quoth first. If no patterns exist, it asks whether to create new documentation.
</Callout>

### Example Workflow

```
You: /prompt quoth_architect

Claude: Architect persona activated. I will search Quoth before
generating any code.

You: Create a Vitest test for the UserService

Claude: [Searching Quoth for "vitest testing patterns"...]
        [Reading patterns/backend-unit-vitest.md...]

According to your documented patterns, Vitest tests should:
- Use `describe/it` blocks with descriptive names
- Mock dependencies with `vi.fn()` (never `jest.fn()`)
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

Here's your test following these patterns:
[generates compliant code]
```

## The Auditor Persona

**When to use:** During code review or PR analysis

The Auditor distinguishes between two types of deviations:

| Type | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Violation** | Code breaks documented patterns | Flag for fix |
| **New Pattern** | Legitimate new approach | Document it |

This prevents the common trap of marking every deviation as "wrong" when some are intentional improvements.

### Example Workflow

```
You: /prompt quoth_auditor

Claude: Auditor persona activated. I will compare code against
documented patterns.

You: Review this PR for pattern compliance

Claude: [Searching Quoth for relevant patterns...]

## Audit Report

### Violations (2)
1. Line 45: Uses `jest.fn()` but docs require `vi.fn()`
2. Line 89: Missing error boundary per error-handling.md

### New Patterns (1)
1. Line 120: Introduces retry logic not in current docs
   Recommendation: Document this pattern if approved
```

## The Documenter Persona

**When to use:** After building new features or patterns

The Documenter creates structured documentation following your templates:

1. **Analyze code** — Understands what was built
2. **Fetch template** — Gets the appropriate doc template from Quoth
3. **Generate doc** — Creates documentation in your format
4. **Propose update** — Submits to Quoth for review

### Example Workflow

```
You: /prompt quoth_documenter

Claude: Documenter persona activated. I will help document your code.

You: Document the new retry utility I just built

Claude: [Fetching template for "utility patterns"...]

I'll create documentation following your patterns/utilities template:

## retry-utility.md

### Purpose
Provides exponential backoff retry logic for API calls.

### Usage
[structured examples]

### Configuration Options
[documented parameters]

Shall I propose this update to Quoth?
```

## Personas vs Tools: Key Distinction

| Aspect | Tools | Personas |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **What** | Functions that do things | Behavior configurations |
| **How** | Claude calls automatically | You activate with `/prompt` |
| **Examples** | `quoth_search_index`, `quoth_read_doc` | `quoth_architect`, `quoth_auditor` |

Tools are the "hands" — they perform actions. Personas are the "mindset" — they determine when and how tools are used.

## Best Practices

1. **One persona per task** — Don't try to mix them
2. **Activate early** — Start with `/prompt` before your request
3. **Trust the process** — Let the persona guide the workflow
4. **Document discoveries** — When Auditor finds new patterns, use Documenter

## Getting Started

1. Connect Quoth to Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http quoth https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp
   ```

2. Run Genesis to populate your knowledge base:
   ```
   /prompt quoth_architect
   Run Genesis for this project
   ```

3. Start using personas in your daily workflow
