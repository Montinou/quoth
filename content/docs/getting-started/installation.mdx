Quoth can be connected to any MCP-compatible AI tool. This guide covers installation for popular platforms.

## Claude Code (CLI)

### Plugin Installation (Recommended)

The Quoth Plugin bundles the MCP server, lightweight hooks (~60 tokens), and the `/quoth-genesis` skill:

```bash
# Add the Quoth marketplace (one time)
/plugin marketplace add Montinou/quoth-mcp

# Install the plugin
/plugin install quoth@quoth-marketplace
```

This gives you:
- All MCP tools including `quoth_guidelines`
- Lightweight hooks that hint Claude to use Quoth patterns
- 🪶 Badge transparency when Quoth is used

### MCP-Only Installation

If you prefer just the MCP server without hooks:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http quoth https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp
```

Then authenticate from the `/mcp` menu.

### Token-Based Installation

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http quoth https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quoth": {
      "url": "https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Restart Claude Desktop after modifying the configuration file.
</Callout>

## Cursor

Cursor supports MCP through its settings:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate to **Features** → **MCP Servers**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a new server with URL: `https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp`
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the Authorization header with your token
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SSE Transport

For clients that require Server-Sent Events transport:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse quoth \
  "https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp/sse?token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Public Demo (No Auth)

For testing without authentication (read-only access):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http quoth-public \
  https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp/public
```

## Verify Installation

Test that Quoth is connected:

```
Search Quoth for "test patterns"
```

If connected, you'll see search results from the Quoth knowledge base.

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="danger">
  **Connection Failed?** Make sure your token hasn't expired. Generate a new one from the [API Keys dashboard](https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/dashboard/api-keys).
</Callout>

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Invalid token" | Regenerate API key from dashboard |
| "Connection refused" | Check your internet connection |
| "Server not responding" | Verify the MCP URL is correct |
| "Unauthorized" | Ensure token is properly formatted in header |
