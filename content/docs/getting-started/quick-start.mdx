This guide will help you connect Quoth to your AI tool and start using it to improve your AI-assisted development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AI tool that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  - Claude Desktop
  - Claude Code (CLI)
  - Cursor
  - Or any MCP-compatible client
- A Quoth account (free tier available)

## Step 1: Create an Account

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Visit [quoth.ai-innovation.site](https://quoth.ai-innovation.site) and click **Get Started**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Sign up with your email address
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Verify your email to activate your account
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect Your AI Tool

### Claude Code (Recommended)

Install the Quoth Plugin to get everything: MCP server, lightweight hooks, and the `/quoth-genesis` skill:

```bash
# Add the Quoth marketplace (one time)
/plugin marketplace add Montinou/quoth-mcp

# Install the plugin
/plugin install quoth@quoth-marketplace
```

<Callout type="info">
  The plugin includes ~60 tokens of lightweight hooks that gently remind Claude to use `quoth_guidelines` when relevant.
</Callout>

### MCP-Only Setup

If you prefer just the MCP tools without hooks:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http quoth https://quoth.ai-innovation.site/api/mcp
```

When prompted, select "Authenticate" from the `/mcp` menu. Your browser will open for login.

## Step 3: Initialize Your Knowledge Base

Run Genesis to automatically document your codebase:

```
/quoth-genesis
```

Or ask Claude directly: "Run Genesis to document this project"

Genesis will analyze your code and create documentation for:
- Project structure and architecture
- Tech stack and dependencies
- Coding conventions and patterns

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with the `minimal` depth level for a quick overview, then run `comprehensive` when you need full documentation.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Start Building

Now when you write code with AI assistance, Claude will automatically receive hints to use Quoth patterns. You can also explicitly ask for guidelines:

```
Use quoth_guidelines('code') and search for authentication patterns
"Create a new API endpoint for user authentication"
```

Claude will search your knowledge base before generating code, ensuring it follows your documented patterns. When Quoth is used, you'll see the 🪶 badge showing which patterns were applied.
