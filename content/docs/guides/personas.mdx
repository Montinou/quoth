title: "Using Quoth Personas"
description: "Master the three AI personas that enforce documentation patterns in your workflow"
order: 2
---

Quoth provides three specialized personas that change how Claude interacts with your codebase. Each persona is designed for a specific workflow phase.

## What Are Personas?

Personas are **behavior configurations**, not tools. When you activate a persona:

- Claude loads a specialized system prompt
- Claude automatically uses Quoth tools in specific ways
- Claude follows rules defined by that persona

<Callout type="warning">
  Personas are activated with `/prompt`, not called like tools. You cannot "use quoth_architect as a tool" — you activate it as a behavioral mode.
</Callout>

## The Three Personas

| Persona | Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Architect** | `/prompt quoth_architect` | Enforce patterns before coding | Writing new code |
| **Auditor** | `/prompt quoth_auditor` | Review code against docs | Code review, PRs |
| **Documenter** | `/prompt quoth_documenter` | Create structured documentation | After building features |

## Architect Persona

The Architect enforces a "search-then-write" pattern that prevents hallucinated code.

### Activation

```
/prompt quoth_architect
```

### Behavior

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Search Quoth** - Before generating any code, Claude searches for relevant patterns
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Read Documentation** - Fetches full content of matching documents
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Generate Compliant Code** - Writes code following documented patterns
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Cite Sources** - References which documents influenced the output
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Session

```
You: /prompt quoth_architect

Claude: Architect persona activated. I will search Quoth before
generating any code to ensure compliance with documented patterns.

You: Create a Vitest test for the login function

Claude: [Searching Quoth for "vitest testing patterns"...]
        [Reading patterns/backend-unit-vitest.md...]

According to your documented patterns, I'll create a test following:
- describe/it blocks with descriptive names
- vi.fn() for mocks (not jest.fn())
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

[generates compliant test code]
```

### Key Rules

- Never generates code without searching first
- If no patterns exist, asks whether to create documentation
- Always cites which docs influenced the output

## Auditor Persona

The Auditor distinguishes between **violations** (code that breaks patterns) and **new patterns** (legitimate innovations).

### Activation

```
/prompt quoth_auditor
```

### Behavior

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Analyze Code** - Examines the code or PR for review
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Search Patterns** - Finds relevant documented standards
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Classify Deviations** - Sorts findings into violations vs. new patterns
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Generate Report** - Produces structured audit output
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Classification Logic

| Finding | Classification | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Uses `jest.fn()` when docs require `vi.fn()` | **Violation** | Fix to match docs |
| Introduces new retry logic not in docs | **New Pattern** | Document if approved |
| Missing error boundary per docs | **Violation** | Add per documentation |
| New caching strategy | **New Pattern** | Review and document |

### Example Session

```
You: /prompt quoth_auditor

Claude: Auditor persona activated. I will compare code against
documented patterns and distinguish violations from new features.

You: Review this file for pattern compliance

Claude: [Searching Quoth for relevant patterns...]
        [Analyzing code against patterns/backend-unit-vitest.md...]

## Audit Report

### Violations (2)
1. Line 45: Uses jest.fn() — docs require vi.fn()
   Source: patterns/backend-unit-vitest.md
   Fix: Replace with vi.fn()

2. Line 89: Missing try-catch per error-handling.md
   Source: patterns/error-handling.md
   Fix: Wrap in error boundary

### New Patterns (1)
1. Line 120: Introduces exponential backoff retry
   Not documented in current patterns
   Recommendation: If approved, use /prompt quoth_documenter
```

## Documenter Persona

The Documenter creates structured documentation following your templates.

### Activation

```
/prompt quoth_documenter
```

### Behavior

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Analyze Code** - Understands what was built
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Determine Type** - Classifies the documentation type needed
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Fetch Template** - Gets the appropriate template from Quoth
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Generate Doc** - Creates documentation in your format
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Propose Update** - Submits to Quoth via `quoth_propose_update`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Session

```
You: /prompt quoth_documenter

Claude: Documenter persona activated. I will help document your code
using Quoth templates.

You: Document the new retry utility I built

Claude: [Fetching template list from Quoth...]
        [This appears to be a utility pattern]
        [Reading template: patterns/utility-template.md...]

I'll create documentation following your utility pattern template:

---
id: retry-utility
type: pattern
related_stack: [typescript, api]
---

## Retry Utility

### Purpose
Provides exponential backoff retry logic for failed API calls.

### Usage
[code examples following your style]

### Parameters
| Param | Type | Description |
...

Shall I propose this update to Quoth?
```

## Switching Between Personas

Each `/prompt` command replaces the current persona. You cannot stack personas.

**Good workflow:**

```
1. /prompt quoth_architect → Write new feature
2. /prompt quoth_auditor → Review the code
3. /prompt quoth_documenter → Document the pattern
```

**Important:** Personas persist for the entire conversation until:
- You start a new conversation
- You activate a different persona
- You explicitly reset

## Personas vs Tools

<CardGrid>
  <Card
    title="Tools (Automatic)"
    description="quoth_search_index, quoth_read_doc, quoth_propose_update — Claude calls these automatically based on context"
    icon="Wrench"
  />
  <Card
    title="Personas (Manual)"
    description="quoth_architect, quoth_auditor, quoth_documenter — You activate these with /prompt to set behavior"
    icon="User"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Troubleshooting

### "Persona isn't working"

**Check:** Did you use `/prompt quoth_architect` or try to call it as a tool?

- Correct: `/prompt quoth_architect`
- Wrong: "Use quoth_architect to generate code"

### "Claude isn't searching Quoth"

The persona activated but Claude decided not to search. Try:

```
You: Before generating any code, search Quoth for relevant patterns
```

### "Which persona should I use?"

| Task | Persona |
|------|---------|
| Writing new code | Architect |
| Reviewing a PR | Auditor |
| Creating documentation | Documenter |
| Running Genesis | Architect |
| Fixing violations | Architect |
