## Projects

Each project represents a separate knowledge base. When you sign up, a default project is automatically created: `{username}-knowledge-base`.

### Project Settings

- **Name** - Display name for your project
- **Slug** - URL-friendly identifier

- **Approval Flow** - Whether proposals require admin approval

## API Keys

API keys are JWT tokens that authenticate MCP connections.

<Callout type="info">
  Projects can disable the approval requirement, allowing editors to update documentation directly.
